For example, given the string , remove an  at positions  and  to make  in  deletions.

Function Description

Complete the alternatingCharacters function in the editor below. It must return an integer representing the minimum number of deletions to make the alternating string.

alternatingCharacters has the following parameter(s):

s: a string
Input Format

The first line contains an integer , the number of queries. 
The next  lines each contain a string .

Constraints

Each string  will consist only of characters  and 
Output Format
